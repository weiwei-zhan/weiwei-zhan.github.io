Ground-motion models (GMM) estimate the ground shaking intensity measures given a set of the earthquake source, path, and site variables, which provides the basis for any seismic risk assessment. In several ongoing works, I improved the accuracy of GMMs and discovered new site variables by integrating nonparametric machine learning and feature selection techniques. I observed that geospatial environmental data contributed to ground-motion modeling.
