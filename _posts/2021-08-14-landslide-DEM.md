To further investigate the extraordinary mobility of rock avalanches, I employed the discrete element method to simulate the entire process of an earthquake-induced landslide (landslide initiation, propagation, and deposition). Through the case study, I observed that the progressive rock fragmentations and violent interparticle collisions significantly contributed to the extraordinary high mobility.
