Landslide-impacted area is another crucial element for individual landslide hazard assessment for slope units close to infrastructure and community. Rock avalanche is a high-mobility type of landslide that can travel a few to tens of kilometers and move a mass of a million to billion cubic meters. I studied the mechanism and practical modeling of landslide mobility of such catastrophic landslides. I compiled a landslide mobility dataset combining remote sensing and in-situ survey data and developed multiple regression models to predict the maximum travel distance of rock avalanches. We found that rock avalanches generally show stronger mobility than rock/soil slides and debris avalanches of similar sizes.
