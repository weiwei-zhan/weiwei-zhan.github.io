Landslide inventory plays an important role in regional landslide susceptibility assessment and uncovering landslide formation mechanisms. I studied the remote-sensing-based landslide mapping and landslide inventory development for earthquake-impacted areas following strong earthquakes. I conducted statistical analyses to investigate the spatial distribution pattern of coseismic landslides with respect to different seismic, terrain, and geological factors. In this setting, I found high landslide density at lower slope sections where the landform evolves from upper, broad valleys to lower, deep-cut gorges. The spatial distribution of the coseismic landslides did not seem correlated to the location of any known active faults. In contrast, I revealed that a previously unknown blind fault segment is the plausible seismogenic fault given the characteristic landslide density break across that fault line.
