The effectiveness of accelerogram-based liquefaction triggering procedure is relying on the two frequency-related parameters of surface ground motions (RL and MIFr).  We selected eight factors to represent source, path, and site effects, and applied the one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) method to rank the correlation between these eight factors and RL and MIFr separately. The results suggest that liquefaction generally has a dominant effect on RL and MIFr.  However, earthquake magnitude and epicentral distance could have similar effects on RL or MIFr, respectively,  as liquefaction does, which needs to be accounted for in applications and improvements of the accelerogram-based liquefaction triggering procedure.
