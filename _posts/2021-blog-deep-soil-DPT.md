The dynamic penetration test (DPT) and the Menard pressuremeter test (PMT) have been widely used in geotechnical survey of deep soils for megadam foundations in western China. The DPT measures are not well utilized due to the lack of correction factors and of empirical relationships for deep soils. I developed a method for DPT correction and empirical relationships between the corrected DPT blow counts with deformation modulus and bearing capacity of deep soils.
