 I developed a new accelerogram-based method and a worldwide database with paired liquefaction observations and ground motion records. The new method consisted of a logistic regression model and an automated signal processing procedure that extracts two physics- informed features for liquefaction detection from the raw accelerograms using different signal processing techniques. I also evaluated the performance and sensitivity of the accelerogram-based liquefaction detection method to different earthquake source, path, and site conditions.
