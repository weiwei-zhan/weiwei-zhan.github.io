The term site response complexity describes the discrepancy between observed site response (i.e., empirical transfer function ETF) and theoretical site response (i.e., theoretical transfer function TTF) predicted using the widely-used one-dimensional site response methods (i.e., SH1D). I derived TTF for ~700 vertical array sites using SH1D simulations and compared them with ETF derived from a large ground motion dataset. I observed noticeable trends between site response complexity and topography: Good-matching sites are mostly located in flat sedimentary basins (where the SH1D assumptions are most valid), and poor-matching sites are often located near mountain/basin edges, and high-interevent-variability sites are located within mountainous areas.
