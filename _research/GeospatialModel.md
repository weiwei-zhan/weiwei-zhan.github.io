Seismic site response (or site effects) describes the effects of near-surface geomaterials on seismic waves as they propagate from bedrock to the ground surface and can lead to vastly different earthquake damage patterns over short distances. Seismic site responses at liquefiable sites are less studied than at other sites due to scarce data observations and numerical challenges in simulating soil liquefaction behaviors. I studied the intersite and interevent variability  of seismic site responses at liquefiable sites by combining large ground motion data processing, signal processing, and statistical analyses.
