Welcome! I am a natural hazard researcher with broad applications in geotechnical earthquake engineering and engineering geology. I am affilated as a postdoctoral scholar in [Geohazards Research Lab](https://sites.tufts.edu/geohazards/) at the Department of Civil Environmental Engineering, Tufts University. I earned my Ph.D. in Civil Engineering from the [Computational Geomechanics Lab] (https://cecas.clemson.edu/geomechanics/) at Clemson University and Bachelor's degree in Engineering Geology from Chengdu University of Technology. 

The goal of my research is to understand the driving mechanisms of natural hazards and to provide novel tools for infrastructure resilience design and natural hazard mitigation. To accomplish this, I have used a combination of applied machine learning, computational geomechanics, remote sensing, signal processing, geospatial analysis, and big data with broad applications. This [research](research) explores broad applications in ground-motion modeling, earthquake site response assessment, liquefaction assessment, landslide risk management. While primarily focused on multiple natural hazard modeling, it also examines performance-based resilience design and near-real-time hazard response. My academic work has been [published](publications) in *Engineering Geology*, *Landslides*, *Journal of Geotechnical & Geoenvironmental Engineering*, and *Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences*, among other outlets. I have [teaching](teaching) experience in both geotechnical engineering and risk engineering.
