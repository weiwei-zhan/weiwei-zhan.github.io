Welcome! I am a natural hazard researcher with broad applications in geotechnical earthquake engineering and engineering geology. I am completing a postdoctoral appointment in the [Geohazards Research Lab](https://sites.tufts.edu/geohazards/) at the Department of Civil Environmental Engineering, Tufts University. I earned my Ph.D. in Civil Engineering from the [Computational Geomechanics Lab](https://cecas.clemson.edu/geomechanics/) at Clemson University and Bachelor's degree in Engineering Geology from the [State Key Laboratory of Geohazard Prevention and Geoenvironment Protection](http://www.sklgp.cdut.edu.cn) at  Chengdu University of Technology. 

The goal of my [research](research) is to understand the driving mechanisms of natural hazards and to provide novel tools for infrastructure resilience design and natural hazard mitigation. To accomplish this, I have used a combination of applied machine learning, computational geomechanics, remote sensing, signal processing, and geospatial analytics with broad applications in geotechnical earthquake engineering and engineering geology. My research efforts span from full-cycle landslide hazard management, real-time liquefaction detection, site response and ground-motion modeling, and remote sensing and geospatial analytics. While primarily focused on multiple natural hazard modeling, it also examines performance-based resilience design and near-real-time hazard response. My academic work has been [published](publications) in *Engineering Geology*, *Landslides*, *Journal of Geotechnical & Geoenvironmental Engineering*, and *Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences*, among other outlets. I have [teaching](teaching) experience in both geotechnical engineering and risk engineering.
