Dr. Weiwei Zhan is a tenure-track Assistant Professor  assistant professor in the Department of Civil, Environmental, and Construction Engineering at the University of Central Florida (UCF). He is the director of the Geosystems Engineering and Intelligence Laboratory (GEI) rooted in the smart cities initiatives at UCF. GEI primarily focuses on understanding the complex hazard-infrastructure-human interactions and advancing urban intelligence and resilience. I study multiple geological hazards, such as earthquakes, landslides, and liquefaction, and their effects on infrastructure systems. I use a wide range of approaches, including remote sensing, signal processing, geomaterial testing, computational simulation, statistical learning, machine learning, and deep learning. Main research thrusts include site-specific and regional assessment of earthquake site responses, ground-motion modeling, near-real-time liquefaction hazard assessment, landslide mechanism and mitigation, geospatial surrogate modeling, and uncertainty quantification. Summaries of my contributions in the mentioned areas are presented below.

<!-- predominantly applied research in environmental and geotechnical engineering in urban areas, including solid waste management, green infrastructure, and local geochemical processes. The PFTPG diagnoses, analyzes, and evaluates the diverse and complicated environmental-systems problems by applying numerical methods, experimental tools, advanced sensing techniques, and site geophysical techniques. -->

<span style="color:red"> About the PI.</span> I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor in the Department of Civil, Environmental, and Construction Engineering (CECE) at the University of Central Florida (UCF). I was a Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Texas Advanced Computing Center](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/) at the University of Texas at Austin and in the [Geohazards Research Lab](https://sites.tufts.edu/geohazards/) at Tufts University. I earned my Ph.D. in Civil Engineering from the [Computational Geomechanics Lab](https://cecas.clemson.edu/geomechanics/) at Clemson University and Bachelor's degree in Engineering Geology from the [State Key Laboratory of Geohazard Prevention and Geoenvironment Protection](http://www.sklgp.cdut.edu.cn) at Chengdu University of Technology. 

<span style="color:red"> Prospective Students.</span> I am actively seeking highly-motivated students for various positions such as Ph.D. students/interns/visiting students. If you are interested in joining my group, please send an email to weiwei.zhan@ucf.edu with your CV and transcripts.
