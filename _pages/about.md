<span style="color:red"> About the PI.</span> I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor in the Department of Civil, Environmental, and Construction Engineering (CECE) at the University of Central Florida (UCF). I was a Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Texas Advanced Computing Center](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/) at the University of Texas at Austin and in the [Geohazards Research Lab](https://sites.tufts.edu/geohazards/) at Tufts University. I earned my Ph.D. in Civil Engineering from the [Computational Geomechanics Lab](https://cecas.clemson.edu/geomechanics/) at Clemson University and Bachelor's degree in Engineering Geology from the [State Key Laboratory of Geohazard Prevention and Geoenvironment Protection](http://www.sklgp.cdut.edu.cn) at Chengdu University of Technology. 

<span style="color:red"> Prospective Students.</span> I am actively seeking highly-motivated students for various positions such as Ph.D. students/interns/visiting students. If you are interested in joining my group, please send an email to weiwei.zhan@ucf.edu with your CV and transcripts.
