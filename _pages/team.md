    <p style="margin-left: 20px;"> <strong>Bella Harandi</strong><br> Bella joined the GEI Lab in Spring 2025. She holds the P3 Postdoctoral Fellowship at the University of Central Florida. Bella earned her Ph.D. degree in Remote Sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS) from the Faculty of Engineering at Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM) in Malaysia in 2018. Following the completion of her Ph.D., she was awarded a Postdoctoral Fellowship at the Disaster Resilience Science Team, RIKEN Center for Advanced Intelligence Project (AIP) in Tokyo, Japan, and subsequently promoted to the role of Research Scientist. Then, she worked as a Postdoctoral Fellow at Macquarie University and a Casual Academic at the University of Technology Sydney, in Australia. Her primary research focus is on the application of machine learning algorithms in spatial science, including geohazard prediction and mitigation. At the GEI Lab, she is supporting multiple remote sensing and machine learning projects.</p>
