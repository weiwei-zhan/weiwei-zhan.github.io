The opportunity to teach is one of my motivations to pursue an academic career. I have gained plenty of insight into both exceptional teaching and effective ways to interact with students by participating different teaching acitivities. I have taught undergraduate courses on Soil Mechanics Lab and served as a teaching assistant for three core courses of Geotechnical Engineering in the Glenn Department of Civil Engineering at Clemson University. In addition, I was a teaching assistant for the [Risk Engineering and Systems Analytics (RESA) Center] (https://catalog.clemson.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=13&poid=3124) where I assisted teaching three online courses on risk engineering, uncertainty quantification, and data mining, and helped fifty worldwide risk analytics from the American International Group (AIG) achieve their online Master's degree.
