The opportunity to teach is one of my motivations to pursue an academic career. I have gained plenty of insight into both exceptional teaching and effective ways to interact with students by participating different teaching acitivities. I have taught undergraduate courses on Soil Mechanics Lab and served as a teaching assistant for three Geotechnical Engineering courses in the [Glenn Department of Civil Engineering at Clemson University](http://www.clemson.edu/ce) and three risk engineering courses in the [Risk Engineering and Systems Analytics (RESA) Center](https://catalog.clemson.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=13&poid=3124).
